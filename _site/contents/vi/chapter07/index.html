<h1 id="lecture-decentralized-autonomous-organizations-daos">Lecture: Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)</h1>

<h2 id="1-tổng-quan-về-khái-niệm">1. Tổng quan về khái niệm</h2>

<p><strong>DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization)</strong> là một organizational structure được govern bởi smart contracts và controlled bởi members thông qua token voting, không có central authority. DAOs represent một revolutionary approach to organizing people và capital, enabling coordination without traditional corporate hierarchies.</p>

<p><strong>The DAO Vision</strong>:</p>

<p>Concept được popularize bởi <strong>Vitalik Buterin</strong> và <strong>The DAO</strong> project (2016). Core idea:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Organizations governed by code, not people. Decisions made through democratic voting, executed automatically by smart contracts.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Traditional Organization</strong> vs <strong>DAO</strong>:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Traditional Company:
- CEO/Board makes decisions
- Shareholders vote occasionally (annual meetings)
- Management executes decisions
- Legal entity với jurisdiction
- Opaque decision-making

DAO:
- Token holders make ALL decisions
- Continuous voting (any time)
- Smart contracts execute automatically
- No legal entity (or experimental structures)
- Fully transparent on-chain
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Historical Timeline</strong>:</p>

<p><strong>2013</strong>: Vitalik proposes DAO concept
<strong>2016</strong>: “The DAO” launches</p>
<ul>
  <li>Raised $150M (largest crowdfund ever!)</li>
  <li>Held 14% of all ETH</li>
  <li>June 2016: Hacked (reentrancy), $50M stolen</li>
  <li>Hard fork decision via community vote</li>
  <li>Ethereum/Ethereum Classic split</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>2017-2019</strong>: DAO concept dormant (post-hack)
<strong>2020-2021</strong>: DAO renaissance</p>
<ul>
  <li>MakerDAO (DeFi governance)</li>
  <li>Uniswap DAO (UNI token launch)</li>
  <li>Compound governance</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>2022-2024</strong>: DAO maturation</p>
<ul>
  <li>ConstitutionDAO ($47M raised to buy Constitution)</li>
  <li>Thousands of active DAOs</li>
  <li>Legal frameworks emerging (Wyoming DAO LLC)</li>
  <li>Tooling improves (Snapshot, Tally)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Current State</strong> (2024):</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Active DAOs</strong>: 10,000+</li>
  <li><strong>Members</strong>: Millions</li>
  <li><strong>Treasury Value</strong>: $20B+</li>
  <li><strong>Governance Tokens</strong>: 100s</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Use Cases</strong>:</p>

<p><strong>DeFi Governance</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>MakerDAO: Manages DAI stablecoin</li>
  <li>Uniswap: Protocol upgrades</li>
  <li>Aave: Risk parameters</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Investment DAOs</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The LAO: Venture funding</li>
  <li>FlamingoDAO: NFT investments</li>
  <li>MetaCartel: Grant funding</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Social DAOs</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Friends with Benefits: Creator community</li>
  <li>BanklessDAO: Education</li>
  <li>Developer DAO: Web3 builders</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Protocol DAOs</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>ENS DAO: Ethereum Name Service</li>
  <li>Gitcoin DAO: Public goods funding</li>
  <li>Optimism Collective: Retroactive funding</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="21-dao-như-digital-cooperative">2.1. DAO như “Digital Cooperative”</h3>

<p><strong>Traditional Cooperative</strong>:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Members pool money
Vote on decisions (in-person meetings)
Board executes decisions
Profits distributed

Example: Farm co-op
- Farmers contribute
- Vote on what to plant
- Share equipment
- Split profits
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>DAO</strong>:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Members buy governance tokens
Vote on proposals (on-chain)
Smart contracts execute automatically
Treasury distributed programmatically

Example: Investment DAO
- Members contribute ETH
- Vote on investments
- Smart contracts manage portfolio
- Profits auto-distributed
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="22-governance-process---proposal-pipeline">2.2. Governance Process - “Proposal Pipeline”</h3>

<p><strong>Typical DAO Workflow</strong>:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Step 1: DISCUSSION (Forum)
└─ Anyone proposes idea
└─ Community discusses
└─ Refine proposal

Step 2: TEMPERATURE CHECK (Off-chain vote)
└─ Snapshot voting (no gas!)
└─ Gauge community interest
└─ No binding execution

Step 3: FORMAL PROPOSAL (On-chain)
└─ Submit proposal to smart contract
└─ Requires minimum tokens to propose
└─ Voting period starts (e.g., 3 days)

Step 4: VOTING
└─ Token holders vote YES/NO
└─ Weight by token balance
└─ Quorum required (minimum participation)

Step 5: EXECUTION
└─ If passed: Smart contract executes automatically
└─ If failed: Proposal rejected
└─ Timelock delay (e.g., 2 days) for safety

Timeline: ~1 week idea → execution
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Example Proposal</strong>:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Proposal #42: "Invest 100 ETH in Project X"

Discussion: 2 days
Temperature check: 1 day (75% support)
Formal voting: 3 days
  - For: 10M tokens (60%)
  - Against: 6.7M tokens (40%)
  - Quorum: 5M tokens required ✓
Timelock: 2 days
Execution: Smart contract transfers 100 ETH to Project X

Total: 8 days from idea to execution
No CEO needed!
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="23-token-voting---shareholder-meeting">2.3. Token Voting - “Shareholder Meeting”</h3>

<p><strong>One Token = One Vote</strong>:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Traditional:
- One share = one vote
- Annual shareholder meeting
- Proxy voting allowed

DAO:
- One governance token = one vote
- Continuous voting
- On-chain, transparent
- No proxy needed (delegate directly)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Voting Power</strong>:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Total Supply: 100M tokens

Alice holds: 1M tokens (1%)
Bob holds: 5M tokens (5%)
Whale holds: 20M tokens (20%)

Proposal to increase fees:
- Whale votes YES (20M votes)
- Many small holders vote NO (15M votes total)
- Result: YES wins (20M &gt; 15M)

Problem: Plutocracy (rich control!)
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="24-treasury-management---community-piggy-bank">2.4. Treasury Management - “Community Piggy Bank”</h3>

<p><strong>DAO Treasury</strong>:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Traditional Company Treasury:
- CFO controls
- Board approval needed
- Opaque accounting

DAO Treasury:
- Smart contract controls
- Token vote needed
- Transparent on-chain

Example:
Treasury: 10,000 ETH + 5M USDC + 100 BTC

Proposals can:
- Spend funds (grants, investments)
- Earn yield (DeFi strategies)
- Buyback tokens
- Distribute to members

All governed by voting!
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="25-delegation---representative-democracy">2.5. Delegation - “Representative Democracy”</h3>

<p><strong>Direct Democracy</strong> (every holder votes):</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Pros: Everyone has voice
Cons: Low participation, voter fatigue

Uniswap example:
- 1B UNI tokens
- Average voter turnout: ~5%
- Most holders don't vote!
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Delegated Voting</strong>:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Token holder → Delegates to expert
Expert → Votes on behalf

Example:
- Alice holds 100 UNI
- Delegates to Bob (DeFi expert)
- Bob votes with Alice's 100 UNI
- Alice can undelegate anytime

Benefits:
✓ Higher participation
✓ Informed decisions
✓ Still democratic (can undelegate)
</code></pre></div></div>

G = 0 (perfect equality)

Distribution B (Concentrated):
1 whale: 50M tokens
99 others: 500K tokens each
G ≈ 0.49 (high inequality)

Higher G = More centralized governance!
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Minimum Winning Coalition</strong>:</p>

<p>[
MWC = \min\left{\text{voters} : \sum_{i \in \text{voters}} v_i &gt; \frac{V}{2}\right}
]</p>

<p>Where ( V ) = total voting power</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Whale-dominated:
- Top 3 holders: 51% of tokens
- MWC = 3 (highly centralized!)

Distributed:
- Need 5,000 holders for 51%
- MWC = 5,000 (decentralized)
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="42-quadratic-voting">4.2. Quadratic Voting</h3>

<p><strong>Problem</strong>: One token = one vote leads to plutocracy</p>

<p><strong>Solution</strong>: Cost increases quadratically</p>

<p>[
\text{Cost}(n \text{ votes}) = n^2
]</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Linear (normal):
- 1 vote costs 1 token
- 100 votes cost 100 tokens
- Whales dominate

Quadratic:
- 1 vote costs 1² = 1 token
- 10 votes cost 10² = 100 tokens
- 100 votes cost 100² = 10,000 tokens!

Whale cannot buy as much influence!
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Effectiveness</strong>:</p>

<p>[
\text{Influence}(n \text{ votes}) = n \times \text{vote_weight}
]</p>

<p><strong>Comparison</strong>:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Linear voting:
Alice: 100 tokens → 100 votes
Bob: 10,000 tokens → 10,000 votes
Bob has 100× more influence

Quadratic voting:
Alice: 100 tokens → 10 votes (√100)
Bob: 10,000 tokens → 100 votes (√10,000)
Bob has 10× more influence (fairer!)
