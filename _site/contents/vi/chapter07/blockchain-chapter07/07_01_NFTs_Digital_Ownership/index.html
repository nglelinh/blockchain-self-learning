    Lecture 07.01: NFTs và Digital Ownership - Non-Fungible Tokens
    
  </h1>
  <h1 id="lecture-nfts-và-digital-ownership---non-fungible-tokens">Lecture: NFTs và Digital Ownership - Non-Fungible Tokens</h1>

<h2 id="1-concept-overview">1. Concept Overview</h2>

<p>Non-Fungible Tokens, hay NFTs, đại diện cho một paradigm shift fundamental trong cách chúng ta conceptualize ownership trong digital realm. Trước blockchain, digital assets luôn có một vấn đề bản chất: chúng có thể được copy perfectly với zero cost. Một file MP3, một bức ảnh digital, một tài liệu - tất cả đều có thể được duplicate infinitely. Điều này tạo ra một tension giữa abundance của digital goods và scarcity cần thiết cho economic value.</p>

<p>NFTs giải quyết vấn đề này bằng cách tạo ra <strong>provable scarcity</strong> và <strong>verifiable ownership</strong> cho digital assets thông qua blockchain technology. Concept cốt lõi là mỗi NFT là một unique token trên blockchain, không thể được exchanged one-to-one với token khác (non-fungible), và ownership history được tracked permanently và transparently. Điều này transform digital items từ infinitely copyable sang uniquely ownable, opening up entirely new categories của digital commerce và creative expression.</p>

<p>Historical context của NFTs bắt đầu sớm hơn nhiều người nghĩ. Năm 2012, <strong>Colored Coins</strong> trên Bitcoin đã attempt represent real-world assets on-chain. Năm 2014, <strong>Counterparty</strong> platform cho phép create custom tokens. Nhưng NFT movement thực sự bắt đầu năm 2017 với <strong>CryptoPunks</strong> - 10,000 unique pixel art characters được generate algorithmically và distributed free trên Ethereum. Cùng năm đó, <strong>CryptoKitties</strong> exploded, một game cho phép breed và trade digital cats, congesting Ethereum network và demonstrating demand for digital collectibles.</p>

<p>Năm 2021 witnessed NFT boom unprecedented. Artist <strong>Beeple</strong> bán một NFT artwork với giá $69 million tại Christie’s auction house, marking first time một major auction house sold purely digital art. <strong>Bored Ape Yacht Club</strong> became cultural phenomenon, với celebrities và brands rushing to acquire these profile pictures. Trading volume reached billions of dollars monthly, và NFT expanded far beyond art into domains như gaming, music, real estate, identity, và credentials.</p>

<p>Nhưng NFTs không chỉ là speculation bubble hay digital art craze. Chúng represent một innovation fundamental: <strong>programmable ownership</strong>. Traditional ownership requires legal systems, title offices, và trusted intermediaries để enforce. NFT ownership được enforce bởi code và cryptography, enabling new forms của fractional ownership, royalty automation, và composable digital assets. Một musician có thể embed royalty logic directly vào NFT, ensuring họ receive percentage mỗi khi NFT được resold. A game item có thể exist across multiple games. Digital identity credentials có thể be self-sovereign và verifiable.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="2-intuitive-understanding">2. Intuitive Understanding</h2>

<p>Để hiểu NFTs deeply, hãy contrast với fungible tokens. Fungibility là property rằng mọi unit của asset đều identical và interchangeable. Một dollar bill có thể được exchanged với any other dollar bill without loss of value. Bitcoin và Ethereum đều fungible - mỗi BTC hay ETH giống hệt nhau về function và value. Điều này perfect cho currency, nhưng terrible cho representing unique items.</p>

<p>Hãy tưởng tượng bạn sở hữu một bức tranh nổi tiếng - ví dụ Mona Lisa. Bức tranh này unique, có provenance specific, và value không thể được reduced thành exchange rate. Bạn không thể “split” Mona Lisa thành smaller equivalent pieces. Bạn không thể exchange nó one-to-one với any other painting. Đây chính là non-fungibility - uniqueness và non-interchangeability.</p>

<p>NFTs bring concept này vào digital world. Thay vì represent uniform units of value như ERC-20 tokens, NFTs represent unique items. Mỗi NFT có một token ID duy nhất, có thể have metadata associated (image, description, properties), và ownership được tracked separately. Khi bạn own một CryptoPunk NFT, bạn không own “một unit of CryptoPunks” - bạn own <strong>that specific CryptoPunk với specific attributes</strong>. Nó như owning painting #5432 trong collection, không thể confused với painting #5433.</p>

<p>Visual mental model hữu ích là nghĩ về NFTs như <strong>digital certificates of authenticity</strong>. Trong art world, certificates of authenticity accompany expensive artworks để prove provenance và authenticity. NFTs serve similar function nhưng với advantages profound. Traditional certificates có thể be forged, lost, disputed. NFT certificates exist on blockchain, impossible to forge (cryptographically secured), impossible to lose (always on-chain), và impossible to dispute (transparent ownership history). Moreover, NFT itself CAN contain hoặc point to the digital asset, creating inseparable link giữa certificate và artwork.</p>

<p>Smart contract functionality thêm một dimension entirely new. NFTs không chỉ represent ownership - chúng có thể contain <strong>programmable logic</strong>. Một NFT ticket có thể automatically expire after event. Một NFT song có thể pay artist percentage mỗi time được resold. Một NFT game item có thể level up based on usage. Đây là <strong>smart property</strong> - assets với built-in rules và behaviors, không require external enforcement.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="3-technical-foundation">3. Technical Foundation</h2>

<p>NFT standards trên Ethereum được define through ERCs (Ethereum Request for Comments). Standard fundamental nhất là <strong>ERC-721</strong>, proposed bởi <strong>William Entriken, Dieter Shirley, Jacob Evans, và Nastassia Sachs</strong> năm 2018. ERC-721 defines minimal interface mà NFT contract phải implement để be interoperable với wallets, marketplaces, và other contracts.</p>

<p>Core functions của ERC-721 include <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">balanceOf</code>, which returns number of NFTs owned bởi address; <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ownerOf</code>, which returns owner của specific token ID; <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">transferFrom</code>, which transfers ownership; <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">approve</code>, which authorizes another address to transfer specific NFT; và <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">safeTransferFrom</code>, which safely transfers với check rằng recipient có thể handle NFTs. Importantly, mỗi token được identify bởi unique <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">uint256</code> token ID, allowing representation của up to 2^256 different unique items.</p>

<p>Metadata handling trong NFTs typically follows pattern này: contract stores base URI và token ID maps to specific metadata file. Metadata thường stored off-chain (IPFS, Arweave, hoặc centralized server) vì storing large data on-chain prohibitively expensive. Ví dụ, CryptoPunk image itself không stored on Ethereum - chỉ có reference đến image. Điều này creates tension: NFT ownership on-chain permanent, nhưng actual content may not be. Best practices recommend decentralized storage (IPFS với content addressing) để ensure persistence.</p>

<p>ERC-1155, proposed bởi <strong>Enjin team</strong>, extends NFT concept bằng cách allowing <strong>multi-token standard</strong>. Single ERC-1155 contract có thể manage multiple token types - both fungible và non-fungible. Điều này particularly useful cho gaming, where you might have thousands of unique items plus fungible currencies. Gas efficiency improved significantly vì batch transfers possible. Ví dụ, transferring 100 different items có thể done trong single transaction thay vì 100 separate transactions như ERC-721 requires.</p>

<p>NFT composition patterns đã evolved sophisticated. <strong>Nested NFTs</strong> allow one NFT to own other NFTs - ví dụ, character NFT owning weapon NFTs. <strong>Fractionalized NFTs</strong> split expensive NFT thành multiple fungible shares, enabling collective ownership. <strong>Dynamic NFTs</strong> change metadata based on external conditions - sports NFT updating với player statistics, game character NFT leveling up. <strong>Soulbound Tokens (SBTs)</strong> proposed bởi Vitalik Buterin represent non-transferable NFTs for identity và credentials - once issued, cannot be sold hoặc transferred, only revoked by issuer.</p>

<p>Contract architecture for NFTs typically separates concerns. Main contract handles ownership tracking và transfers. Metadata contract or service provides token information. Marketplace contracts facilitate buying/selling. Royalty contracts ensure creators receive percentage on secondary sales. This modularity enables ecosystem evolution - new marketplaces can emerge without requiring new token contracts, và existing NFTs remain compatible.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="4-mathematical--cryptographic-formulation">4. Mathematical / Cryptographic Formulation</h2>

<p>NFT uniqueness mathematically guaranteed through token ID space. Với <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">uint256</code> token IDs, total possible unique tokens is:</p>

<p>[
N_{\max} = 2^{256} \approx 1.16 \times 10^{77}
]</p>

<p>Đây là số lớn hơn estimated số atoms trong observable universe (approximately (10^{80})). Practically unlimited uniqueness space, ensuring no collision concerns trong design space.</p>

<p>Ownership verification trong NFTs relies on same cryptographic primitives như fungible tokens. Given NFT contract (C) và token ID (t), ownership query (\text{ownerOf}(t)) returns address (A). To prove ownership, holder of address (A) must demonstrate knowledge của private key corresponding đến (A)’s public key. This follows ECDSA signature scheme discussed in earlier lectures, với security reduced to discrete logarithm problem on elliptic curves.</p>

<p>Transfer safety được ensure through multiple mechanisms. Basic <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">transferFrom</code> function simply changes ownership mapping:</p>

<p>[
\text{owner}[t] \leftarrow A_{\text{new}} \quad \text{(atomic state update)}
]</p>

<p>However, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">safeTransferFrom</code> adds verification step. Before transferring, contract calls recipient với selector <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">onERC721Received</code>:</p>

<p>[
\text{if recipient is contract: require}(recipient.\text{onERC721Received}(…) = \text{MAGIC_VALUE})
]</p>

<p>This prevents accidental transfers đến contracts không equipped để handle NFTs, avoiding permanent loss. Magic value <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0x150b7a02</code> serves như confirmation rằng contract implements proper interface.</p>

<p>Royalty mathematics trong ERC-2981 standard defines royalty info function:</p>

<p>[
(\text{receiver}, \text{royaltyAmount}) = \text{royaltyInfo}(\text{tokenId}, \text{salePrice})
]</p>

<p>Where:</p>

<p>[
\text{royaltyAmount} = \text{salePrice} \times \frac{\text{royaltyBasisPoints}}{10000}
]</p>

<p>Ví dụ, với 5% royalty (500 basis points) và sale price 10 ETH:</p>

<p>[
\text{royaltyAmount} = 10 \times \frac{500}{10000} = 0.5 \text{ ETH}
]</p>

<p>Creator automatically receives 0.5 ETH mỗi sale.</p>

<p>Rarity trong generative NFT projects often follows statistical distributions. For collection với (n) traits, each trait có (m_i) variants, total possible combinations:</p>

<p>[
C = \prod_{i=1}^{n} m_i
]</p>

<p>For CryptoPunks với 7 attributes (type, hair, eyes, etc.), mỗi có variable number of options, total combinations exceed collection size (10,000), ensuring uniqueness. Rarity score thường calculated as:</p>

<p>[
R(t) = \sum_{i=1}^{k} \frac{1}{f_i}
]</p>

<p>Where (f_i) là frequency của trait (i) in collection. Rare traits contribute more to overall rarity score.</p>

<p>Real-world implementations như OpenSea, Rarible, và Foundation build on these primitives nhưng add features extensive như collection verification, lazy minting (mint only when sold), auctions (English, Dutch), bundles, và cross-chain support. Gas optimizations critical - high-volume collections use techniques như ERC721A (Azuki’s optimization enabling batch minting at near-singular gas cost) và merkle proofs for allowlists.</p>

<h2 id="6-common-challenges--attacks--trade-offs">6. Common Challenges / Attacks / Trade-offs</h2>

<p>NFT ecosystem faces numerous challenges requiring careful consideration. Metadata permanence remains contentious issue. Khi NFT points đến off-chain resource via HTTP URL, resource có thể disappear if server goes down. IPFS provides improvement through content addressing - URL derived from file hash, ensuring retrievability as long as anyone pins content - nhưng không guarantee permanent availability. Arweave attempts solve này through permanent storage model với upfront payment, but economic sustainability remains unproven long-term.</p>

<p>Smart contract bugs trong NFT contracts particularly dangerous given value at risk. Phishing attacks common - malicious contracts mimicking legitimate ones, tricking users into approving unauthorized transfers. Approval mechanisms trong ERC-721 create attack surface: calling <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">setApprovalForAll</code> grants contract permission to transfer ALL of user’s NFTs from that collection. Users frequently unaware of this risk, approving malicious contracts.</p>

<p>Wash trading manipulates NFT prices through self-dealing. Attacker owns NFT, sells to themselves từ different wallet at inflated price, creating appearance of legitimate sale. This inflates floor price metrics và misleads buyers. On-chain analysis can detect patterns but difficult to prevent entirely. Marketplaces implement heuristics như flagging rapid back-and-forth sales between wallets, nhưng sophisticated wash traders adapt.</p>

<p>Copyright và intellectual property issues pervade NFT space. Owning NFT typically không grant copyright to underlying work unless explicitly stated. Buyer owns token on blockchain nhưng creator retains IP rights. This confusing for many users expecting full ownership. Additionally, anyone có thể mint NFT pointing đến content they don’t own - plagiarism rampant. Verification systems như Twitter Blue checkmarks for verified collections attempt address này, but remain centralized solutions.</p>

<p>Royalty enforcement shows technical limitations of decentralized systems. ERC-2981 standard defines royalty interface, nhưng enforcement requires marketplace cooperation. Nothing prevents direct wallet-to-wallet transfer bypassing royalties entirely. Marketplaces voluntarily honor royalties, but cannot be forced on-chain. Proposals like ERC-4910 (royalty-enforced NFTs) attempt make royalties mandatory through transfer restrictions, but this limits composability và faces adoption challenges.</p>

<p>Environmental concerns about NFT energy consumption largely addressed through Ethereum’s Merge to Proof-of-Stake. Pre-merge, minting NFT on Ethereum consumed approximately 200 kWh (carbon footprint of 100 kg CO2). Post-merge, energy consumption reduced 99.95%, making NFT carbon footprint comparable to sending email. However, perception issues remain, và some artists still avoid NFTs for environmental reasons.</p>

<h2 id="7-related-concepts">7. Related Concepts</h2>

<p>NFTs exist within broader ecosystem của digital ownership innovations. <strong>Decentralized Identity (DID)</strong> leverages NFT-like tokens for self-sovereign identity credentials. Rather than identity document issued by government và stored in database, DIDs enable individuals hold verifiable credentials as tokens, presenting proofs without revealing underlying data. This connects to <strong>Soulbound Tokens (SBTs)</strong> concept proposed by Vitalik Buterin, Glen Weyl, và Puja Ohlhaver - non-transferable tokens representing achievements, credentials, hoặc memberships, creating <strong>Decentralized Society (DeSoc)</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Fractionalization</strong> creates fascinating intersection between NFTs và DeFi. Platforms như Fractional.art allow expensive NFT be split thành fungible ERC-20 shares, enabling collective ownership và liquid markets for otherwise illiquid assets. Mathematics straightforward: NFT locked in vault contract, vault issues (n) shares, each representing (1/n) ownership. Buyout mechanisms allow anyone purchase all shares at threshold price, retrieving original NFT.</p>

<p><strong>Dynamic NFTs</strong> blur line giữa static collectibles và evolving digital entities. Using <strong>Chainlink oracles</strong>, NFT metadata can update based on real-world events. Sports player NFT could reflect current season statistics, updated automatically. Weather NFT could change appearance based on actual weather data. This requires careful contract design separating immutable aspects (ownership, provenance) from mutable (metadata URI, properties).</p>

<p><strong>NFT standards comparison</strong> reveals design tradeoffs. ERC-721 optimized cho unique items, simple interface, but expensive cho large collections. ERC-1155 enables batch operations, mixing fungible và non-fungible, reducing gas substantially for games và metaverses. ERC-998 (Composable NFTs) allows NFTs own other tokens, creating hierarchies - parent NFT sold includes all children automatically. Each standard serves different use cases, và choosing appropriate standard critical for project success.</p>

<p><strong>Cross-chain NFTs</strong> represent next frontier. Projects like Axie Infinity initially on Ethereum, migrated to Ronin sidechain for scalability. Omnichain NFTs (LayerZero) enable single NFT exist across multiple chains simultaneously. User bridges NFT between chains as needed, maintaining unified identity. This requires sophisticated cross-chain messaging và handling of edge cases like conflicting states.</p>

<h2 id="10-summary-và-key-takeaways">10. Summary và Key Takeaways</h2>

<p>NFTs represent paradigm shift in digital ownership, creating verifiable scarcity và programmable property rights cho digital assets through blockchain technology. Core innovation lies trong ability to prove ownership cryptographically without requiring centralized authority, enabled by smart contract standards như ERC-721 và ERC-1155. These standards define interfaces allowing NFTs be universally recognized across wallets, marketplaces, và applications, creating composable ecosystem.</p>

<p>Technical implementation builds on Ethereum’s account model và EVM execution environment. Unique token IDs within 256-bit space provide effectively unlimited uniqueness, while ownership tracked via mapping data structure in contract storage. Transfer mechanisms incorporate safety checks preventing accidental loss, và approval systems enable delegated management. Metadata handling typically hybrid - contract on-chain points to off-chain resources via URIs, balancing cost với functionality.</p>

<p>Mathematical foundations ensure security và uniqueness. Cryptographic signatures prove ownership, collision resistance của hash functions guarantee token ID uniqueness, và Merkle proofs enable efficient verification. Royalty calculations embedded in contracts enable creators earn from secondary market automatically, though enforcement depends on marketplace cooperation rather than protocol-level guarantees.</p>

<p>Challenges include metadata permanence concerns, copyright confusion, wash trading manipulation, và scalability limitations. Solutions emerging through improved storage solutions (IPFS, Arweave), better verification systems, marketplace standards, và Layer 2 scaling. NFT applications extending far beyond digital art into gaming, music, credentials, real estate tokenization, và decentralized identity.</p>

<p>Future directions include dynamic NFTs responding to real-world data, fractionalization enabling collective ownership, cross-chain NFTs operating across multiple blockchains, và soulbound tokens for non-transferable credentials. NFT ecosystem continues evolving rapidly, với new standards, tools, và use cases emerging continuously. Understanding NFT fundamentals - from ERC standards to marketplace mechanics to security considerations - essential for anyone building in Web3 space.</p>
