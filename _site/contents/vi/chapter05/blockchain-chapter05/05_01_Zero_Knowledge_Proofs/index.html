  </h1>
  <h1 id="lecture-zero-knowledge-proofs---prove-without-revealing">Lecture: Zero-Knowledge Proofs - Prove Without Revealing</h1>

<h2 id="1-tổng-quan-về-khái-niệm">1. Tổng quan về khái niệm</h2>

<p><strong>Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP)</strong> là một trong những breakthroughs quan trọng nhất trong cryptography và blockchain technology. ZKP cho phép một party (prover) chứng minh với another party (verifier) rằng một statement là true, <strong>without revealing any information beyond the truth of the statement itself</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>The Magic of Zero-Knowledge</strong>:</p>

<p>Tưởng tượng bạn muốn chứng minh với ai đó rằng bạn biết password, nhưng không muốn reveal password. Với zero-knowledge proof, điều này hoàn toàn possible!</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Traditional Proof:
You: "I know the password"
Verifier: "Prove it"
You: "The password is: hunter2"
Verifier: "OK, I believe you"

Problem: Verifier now knows password too!

Zero-Knowledge Proof:
You: "I know the password"  
Verifier: "Prove it without telling me"
You: [Generates cryptographic proof]
Verifier: [Verifies proof] "OK, I believe you"

Result: Verifier convinced, but learned NOTHING about password!
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Formal Definition</strong> (Goldwasser, Micali, Rackoff, 1985):</p>

<p>A ZKP system for statement ( x ) must satisfy:</p>

<p><strong>1. Completeness</strong>: Nếu statement true, honest prover can convince verifier
[
P(\text{verifier accepts} | x \text{ is true}) = 1
]</p>

<p><strong>2. Soundness</strong>: Nếu statement false, no cheating prover can convince verifier
[
P(\text{verifier accepts} | x \text{ is false}) &lt; \epsilon \quad \text{(negligible)}
]</p>

<p><strong>3. Zero-Knowledge</strong>: Verifier learns nothing except truth of statement
[
\text{View}_{\text{verifier}} \stackrel{c}{\equiv} \text{Simulator output}
]</p>

<p>Meaning: Anything verifier learns could have been simulated without prover!</p>

<h3 id="21-ali-babas-cave---classic-zkp-example">2.1. Ali Baba’s Cave - Classic ZKP Example</h3>

<p><strong>The Story</strong>:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Ali Baba discovers cave với magic door
Door opens với secret password

Wants to prove: "I know password"
Without revealing: The actual password

Setup:
        [Entrance]
           / \
          /   \
     Path A   Path B
          \   /
           \ /
      [Magic Door]
      (needs password)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Protocol</strong>:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Round 1:
1. Ali Baba enters cave, chooses Path A or B randomly
2. Verifier stays outside (doesn't see which path)
3. Verifier shouts: "Come out via Path A!"
4. Ali Baba uses password to go through door if needed
5. Exits via Path A
6. Verifier sees: "He exited via requested path"

If Ali didn't know password:
- Probability of success: 50% (lucky guess)

Repeat 20 times:
- If Ali knows password: 100% success
- If Ali doesn't: (0.5)^20 ≈ 0.0001% success

After 20 rounds, verifier convinced with 99.9999% certainty!
But learned NOTHING about password itself!
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Properties Demonstrated</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>✅ Completeness: Real password owner succeeds</li>
  <li>✅ Soundness: Fake cannot succeed (repeatedly)</li>
  <li>✅ Zero-knowledge: Verifier learns only “Ali knows password”</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="22-wheres-waldo---computational-analogy">2.2. Where’s Waldo - Computational Analogy</h3>

<p><strong>Problem</strong>: Prove you found Waldo without revealing location</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Traditional:
You: "Waldo is at coordinates (234, 567)"
Verifier: Checks → "Correct!"

Problem: Verifier now knows location

Zero-Knowledge:
You: Cut out large piece of paper với hole
     Place over page so ONLY Waldo shows through hole
     Everything else covered
Verifier: Sees Waldo through hole
         Convinced you found him
         But doesn't know position on page!

This is zero-knowledge!
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="23-sudoku-proof---commitment-scheme">2.3. Sudoku Proof - Commitment Scheme</h3>

<p><strong>Setup</strong>: Prove you solved Sudoku without revealing solution</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>1. Write solution on paper
2. Put in locked box
3. Give box to verifier
4. Verifier checks:
   - Box is sealed
   - Cannot see inside
5. Later, open box
6. Verify solution correct

Properties:
- Commitment: Cannot change solution after box locked
- Hiding: Verifier can't see solution
- Binding: Must reveal same solution later

But this reveals solution eventually!
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>True Zero-Knowledge Sudoku</strong>:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Use cryptographic commitments:
1. Commit to each cell: Com(value, random)
2. Verify constraints without opening:
   - Row sum commitments
   - Column sum commitments  
   - Box sum commitments
3. Prove algebraically constraints satisfied
4. Never reveal individual cell values!

Verifier convinced solution valid
Without learning any cell values!
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="24-colored-balls---interactive-zkp">2.4. Colored Balls - Interactive ZKP</h3>

<p><strong>Setup</strong>: Prove two balls different colors without revealing colors</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Verifier is colorblind
You can see: Ball A is red, Ball B is green

Protocol:
1. Verifier holds both balls behind back
2. Randomly swaps or doesn't swap
3. Shows you balls
4. You say: "Swapped" or "Not swapped"
5. Repeat many times

If balls actually different colors:
└─ You can always tell (100% accuracy)

If balls same color:
└─ You can only guess (50% accuracy)

After 20 rounds:
└─ If 100% correct → Verifier convinced balls different
└─ But verifier learned NOTHING about actual colors!
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="25-password-proof---hash-based-zkp">2.5. Password Proof - Hash-Based ZKP</h3>

<p><strong>Prove knowledge of password without revealing it</strong>:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Setup: Everyone knows H(password) = 0xABC...

Traditional:
You: "Password is: secret123"
Verifier: Checks H("secret123") = 0xABC... ✓

Problem: Password revealed!

Zero-Knowledge (Fiat-Shamir):
You: Generate proof using password
     Proof is function of password + random challenge
     But reveals nothing about password
Verifier: Checks proof mathematically
         Convinced you know password
         Without learning it!

This is basis of authentication protocols!

<p><strong>Prove knowledge of discrete log</strong>:</p>

<p>Given ( y = g^x \mod p ), prove knowledge of ( x ) without revealing it.</p>

<p><strong>Protocol</strong>:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Setup:
- Public: g, p, y = g^x mod p
- Private: x (prover knows this)

Steps:
1. Prover picks random r
2. Prover computes: t = g^r mod p
3. Prover sends t to verifier

4. Verifier picks random challenge c
5. Verifier sends c to prover

6. Prover computes: s = r + c·x
7. Prover sends s to verifier

8. Verifier checks: g^s = t · y^c

Verification:
g^s = g^(r + cx) = g^r · g^(cx) = g^r · (g^x)^c = t · y^c ✓
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Why Zero-Knowledge?</strong></p>

<p>Verifier sees: ( t, c, s )</p>

<p>Can simulate:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Pick random ( s, c )</li>
  <li>Compute ( t = g^s \cdot y^{-c} )</li>
  <li>Output ( (t, c, s) )</li>
</ol>

<p>Simulated transcript indistinguishable from real!</p>

<p>Therefore: Verifier learned nothing beyond “prover knows ( x )”</p>

<h3 id="42-fiat-shamir-heuristic">4.2. Fiat-Shamir Heuristic</h3>

<p><strong>Transform interactive → non-interactive</strong>:</p>

<p>Instead of verifier choosing challenge:</p>

<p>[
c = H(\text{public inputs} \parallel t)
]</p>

<p>Prover computes challenge themselves via hash!</p>

<p><strong>Modified Protocol</strong>:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>1. Prover picks random r
2. Prover computes t = g^r
3. Prover computes c = H(g, y, t)  // Hash challenge!
4. Prover computes s = r + c·x
5. Prover sends (t, s)

Verifier:
1. Computes c = H(g, y, t)
2. Checks g^s = t · y^c

Non-interactive! Single message!
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is foundation của modern zk-SNARKs!</p>

<h3 id="43-r1cs-rank-1-constraint-system">4.3. R1CS (Rank-1 Constraint System)</h3>

<p><strong>Arithmetic circuits → Constraint system</strong>:</p>

<p>Example: Prove ( x^3 + x + 5 = 35 ) with ( x = 3 )</p>

<p><strong>Variables</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>( x ) (private input)</li>
  <li>( sym_1 = x \times x = 9 )</li>
  <li>( sym_2 = sym_1 \times x = 27 )</li>
  <li>( sym_3 = sym_2 + x = 30 )</li>
  <li>( out = sym_3 + 5 = 35 )</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Constraints</strong> (each is rank-1):</p>

<p>[
\begin{align}
x \times x &amp;= sym_1 <br />
sym_1 \times x &amp;= sym_2 <br />
(sym_2 + x) \times 1 &amp;= sym_3 <br />
(sym_3 + 5) \times 1 &amp;= out
\end{align}
]</p>

<p><strong>Matrix Form</strong> (A, B, C matrices):</p>

<p>[
(A \cdot w) \circ (B \cdot w) = (C \cdot w)
]</p>

<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
  <li>( w ) = witness vector (all variables)</li>
  <li>( \circ ) = element-wise product</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Proof Generation</strong>:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Convert program to R1CS</li>
  <li>Generate witness satisfying constraints</li>
  <li>Use cryptographic protocol (Groth16, PLONK) to create proof</li>
  <li>Proof size: constant (128 bytes for Groth16)</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="44-proof-size-vs-security">4.4. Proof Size vs Security</h3>

<p><strong>SNARK Proof Size</strong>:</p>

<p>[
|\text{Proof}_{\text{Groth16}}| = 128 \text{ bytes}
]</p>

<p>Regardless of circuit size!</p>

<p><strong>STARK Proof Size</strong>:</p>

<p>[
|\text{Proof}_{\text{STARK}}| = O(\text{poly}\log(N))
]</p>

<p>Where ( N ) = circuit size</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Circuit: 1 million gates

Groth16 SNARK: 128 bytes
STARK: ~100-200 KB (depending on parameters)

SNARK 1000× smaller!
But STARK no trusted setup.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Security Level</strong>:</p>

<p>Both achieve ~128-bit security:</p>

<p>[
P(\text{forge proof}) \approx 2^{-128} \approx 10^{-38}
]</p>

<p>Computationally infeasible!</p>

<h3 id="45-verification-complexity">4.5. Verification Complexity</h3>

<p><strong>SNARK Verification</strong>:</p>

<p>[
T_{\text{verify}} = O(|x| + |y|)
]</p>

<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <table>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>(</td>
          <td>x</td>
          <td>) = public input size</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
  </li>
  <li>
    <table>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>(</td>
          <td>y</td>
          <td>) = public output size</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Independent of circuit size!</strong></p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Circuit: 1 million gates
Public inputs: 10 values
Public outputs: 1 value

Verification time: ~1ms (constant!)

Compare to re-execution: 
- Would need to execute 1M gates
- Takes seconds to minutes

10,000× faster!
