    Lecture 05.00: Blockchain Privacy - Beyond Pseudonymity
    
  </h1>
  <h1 id="lecture-blockchain-privacy---beyond-pseudonymity">Lecture: Blockchain Privacy - Beyond Pseudonymity</h1>

<h2 id="1-tổng-quan-về-khái-niệm">1. Tổng quan về khái niệm</h2>

<p>Một trong những <strong>misconceptions phổ biến nhất</strong> về blockchain là nó “anonymous”. Thực tế, Bitcoin và hầu hết blockchains chỉ <strong>pseudonymous</strong> (ẩn danh giả) - transactions được link với addresses thay vì tên thật, nhưng tất cả transactions hoàn toàn <strong>public và traceable</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Pseudonymity vs Anonymity</strong>:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Pseudonymous (Bitcoin, Ethereum):
- Addresses không chứa real name
- Nhưng: All transactions public
- Nhưng: Addresses can be linked
- Nhưng: Chain analysis reveals patterns

Example:
Address 0x123...abc receives 10 BTC from exchange (KYC'd)
→ Identity potentially linked
→ All future transactions traceable
→ Not truly anonymous!

Anonymous (Ideal):
- Transactions cannot be traced to individual
- No linking between transactions
- Cannot determine sender/receiver
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>The Privacy Problem</strong>:</p>

<p>Blockchain transparency - một trong những <strong>core features</strong> - cũng là <strong>biggest privacy challenge</strong>:</p>

<p><strong>Transparency Benefits</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>✅ Anyone can verify transactions</li>
  <li>✅ Audit trail permanent</li>
  <li>✅ No hidden inflation</li>
  <li>✅ Trust through verification</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Transparency Drawbacks</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>❌ Financial surveillance possible</li>
  <li>❌ Spending patterns revealed</li>
  <li>❌ Holdings public</li>
  <li>❌ Business intelligence leaked</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Real-World Example</strong>:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Scenario: Company pays employee in Bitcoin

Public blockchain reveals:
- Company wallet address
- Employee wallet address  
- Exact salary amount
- Payment schedule (monthly)
- All employee purchases afterward

Competitors can:
- Analyze company cash flow
- Identify employees
- Track business operations

This is NOT acceptable for enterprise/personal finance!
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Historical Context</strong>:</p>

<p>Privacy trong crypto evolved qua waves:</p>

<p><strong>2009-2013</strong>: Bitcoin assumed anonymous</p>
<ul>
  <li>Early users thought addresses = privacy</li>
  <li>Reality: Chain analysis firms emerged</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>2014-2016</strong>: Privacy coins launched</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Monero (2014)</strong>: Ring signatures, stealth addresses</li>
  <li><strong>Zcash (2016)</strong>: Zero-knowledge proofs (zk-SNARKs)</li>
  <li><strong>Dash</strong>: CoinJoin mixing</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>2017-2020</strong>: Privacy tools mature</p>
<ul>
  <li>CoinJoin implementations (Wasabi, Samourai)</li>
  <li>Tornado Cash (Ethereum mixer)</li>
  <li>Privacy protocols develop</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>2020-2024</strong>: Regulatory scrutiny</p>
<ul>
  <li>Privacy coins delisted from exchanges</li>
  <li>Tornado Cash sanctioned (2022)</li>
  <li>Debate: Privacy vs compliance</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Privacy Trilemma</strong>:</p>

<p>Similar to blockchain trilemma, privacy has tradeoffs:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>        Privacy
         /  \
        /    \
       /      \
      /________\
Compliance   Usability

Monero: High privacy → Low compliance
Bitcoin: High compliance → Low privacy
Zcash: Balance attempt (shielded + transparent pools)

<h3 id="21-chain-analysis---following-money-trail">2.1. Chain Analysis - “Following Money Trail”</h3>

<p><strong>Traditional Cash</strong>:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Alice pays Bob $100 (physical cash)
└─ No record (private)
└─ Bob spends at store
└─ No link to Alice (untraceable)

Perfect privacy!
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Bitcoin</strong> (naive use):</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Alice sends to Bob: Tx 0xABC
└─ Public record forever
└─ Bob sends to Charlie: Tx 0xDEF
└─ Linked! (same address)
└─ Charlie sends to store: Tx 0x123
└─ Full trail visible!

Transaction graph reveals everything!
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Graph Analysis</strong>:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>         Exchange (KYC)
              ↓
         Alice_Addr_1 ────→ Bob_Addr_1
              ↓                  ↓
         Alice_Addr_2      Bob_Addr_2
              ↓                  ↓
         Merchant_A         Merchant_B
         
Chain analysis can:
- Cluster addresses (belong to same entity)
- De-anonymize users (via exchange KYC)
- Track fund flow
- Identify business relationships
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="22-coinjoin---mixing-coins">2.2. CoinJoin - “Mixing Coins”</h3>

<p><strong>Without CoinJoin</strong>:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Alice → Bob:    Tx1 (traceable)
Charlie → Dave: Tx2 (traceable)

Clear mapping: Input → Output
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>With CoinJoin</strong>:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Combined Transaction:
Inputs:  [Alice, Charlie]
Outputs: [Bob, Dave]

Ambiguity: Which input → which output?
- Alice → Bob?
- Alice → Dave?
- Charlie → Bob?
- Charlie → Dave?

Cannot determine without additional info!
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Multiple Participants Better</strong>:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>100 people CoinJoin:
└─ 100 inputs
└─ 100 outputs
└─ 100! possible mappings (10^157 combinations!)

Effectively untraceable!
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="23-ring-signatures---signing-from-group">2.3. Ring Signatures - “Signing from Group”</h3>

<p><strong>Normal Signature</strong>:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Alice signs message
→ Proves: "Alice signed this"
→ Everyone knows Alice signed

No ambiguity!
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Ring Signature</strong> (Monero):</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Ring: [Alice, Bob, Charlie, Dave, Eve]

One person signs (say Alice)
→ Proves: "Someone in ring signed this"
→ Cannot tell who!

Plausible deniability for everyone!
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Analogy</strong>: Secret ballot voting</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>5 people vote
Only know: "Someone voted YES"
Don't know: Who specifically

Ring signature similar!
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="24-zero-knowledge-proofs---prove-without-revealing">2.4. Zero-Knowledge Proofs - “Prove Without Revealing”</h3>

<p><strong>Normal Proof</strong>:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Prove you know password:
→ Reveal password
→ Verifier checks
→ Privacy lost!
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Zero-Knowledge Proof</strong>:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Prove you know password:
→ Don't reveal password
→ Mathematical proof instead
→ Verifier convinced
→ Password stays secret!

Example (Zcash):
Prove: "I have 10 ZEC and right to spend"
Without revealing: Which coins, who sent them, amounts
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Magic Door Analogy</strong>:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>You know secret code to open magic door
Want to prove: "I know code"
Without revealing: The actual code

Method:
1. Go through door (only possible if you know code)
2. Verifier sees you emerged on other side
3. Verifier convinced: "You must know code!"
4. But verifier doesn't learn the code!

This is zero-knowledge: Proved knowledge without revealing it!
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="25-stealth-addresses---one-time-addresses">2.5. Stealth Addresses - “One-Time Addresses”</h3>

<p><strong>Reused Address</strong> (bad for privacy):</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Alice's address: 0x123...abc

Receives from:
- Bob
- Charlie  
- Dave
- Employer
- Exchange

Everyone can see:
- Total balance
- All transaction history
- Spending patterns

No privacy!
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Stealth Addresses</strong> (Monero):</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Alice has: One public address (published)

But each payment goes to:
- Unique one-time address (derived from public address)
- Not linkable to other payments
- Only Alice can detect (with private view key)

Bob, Charlie, Dave send to Alice
→ Each goes to different address
→ Looks like different recipients
→ Only Alice knows they're all hers!

Privacy preserved!

<h3 id="42-chain-analysis-success-probability">4.2. Chain Analysis Success Probability</h3>

<p><strong>Heuristics</strong> cho clustering addresses:</p>

<p><strong>Common Input Ownership</strong>:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>If transaction has inputs from A1 and A2:
P(A1 and A2 same owner) ≈ 0.9

Assumption: Different people unlikely to coordinate
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Change Address Detection</strong>:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Transaction:
Input: 10 BTC from A
Outputs: 6 BTC to B, 4 BTC to C

Heuristic: C is change (round number to B)
P(C is sender's change) ≈ 0.7
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Clustering Accuracy</strong> (empirical):</p>

<p>[
P(\text{correct cluster}) \approx 0.7 - 0.9
]</p>

<p><strong>Defense Against Clustering</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Avoid address reuse</li>
  <li>Use CoinJoin</li>
  <li>Random change amounts</li>
  <li>Coin control</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="43-ring-signature-security">4.3. Ring Signature Security</h3>

<p><strong>Unforgeability</strong>:</p>

<p>Attacker cannot forge signature without knowing any private key in ring.</p>

<p><strong>Security assumption</strong>: Discrete logarithm problem hard</p>

<p><strong>Anonymity</strong>:</p>

<p>[
P(\text{identify signer | signature}) = \frac{1}{n}
]</p>

<p>Where ( n ) = ring size</p>

<p><strong>Linkability</strong>:</p>

<p>Without key image: Attacker cannot tell if two signatures from same signer</p>

<p><strong>Key Image</strong> (prevents double-spending):</p>

<p>[
I = x \cdot H_p(\text{PublicKey})
]</p>

<p>Where ( x ) = private key</p>

<p>Properties:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Unique per key</li>
  <li>Reveals no info about key</li>
  <li>Allows detecting double-spend (same key image = same coins spent twice)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="44-zk-snark-size">4.4. zk-SNARK Size</h3>

<p><strong>Zero-Knowledge Proof Size</strong>:</p>

<p>[
|\text{Proof}| = O(1) \quad \text{(constant size!)}
]</p>

<p><strong>Groth16</strong> (most common):</p>
<ul>
  <li>Proof size: 128 bytes</li>
  <li>Verification time: O(1)</li>
  <li>Setup: Trusted setup required</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Comparison</strong>:</p>

  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Method</th>
      <th>Proof Size</th>
      <th>Verification</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Regular TX</td>
      <td>~250 bytes</td>
      <td>Full re-execution</td>

    <tr>
      <td>zk-STARK</td>
      <td>~100 KB</td>
      <td>~10ms</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p><strong>Privacy Overhead</strong>:</p>

<p>[
\text{Overhead} = \frac{|\text{ZK proof}|}{|\text{Normal TX}|} \approx \frac{128}{250} \approx 0.5
]</p>

<p>Actually smaller than normal transaction!</p>

<p><strong>How Tornado Cash Provides Privacy</strong>:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Deposit Phase:
Alice → Generates secret
     → Computes commitment = hash(secret)
     → Deposits 1 ETH + commitment
     → Commitment added to Merkle tree

Mix Phase:
Bob → Deposits 1 ETH + his commitment
Charlie → Deposits 1 ETH + his commitment
...
100 people deposit 1 ETH each

Withdrawal Phase:
Alice → Generates ZK proof: "I know secret for commitment in tree"
     → Provides nullifier (derived from secret)
     → Withdraws to NEW address
     → Cannot link: New address ← Original deposit

Observer sees:
- 100 deposits
- 100 withdrawals
- Cannot tell which deposit → which withdrawal!

Anonymity set: 100
