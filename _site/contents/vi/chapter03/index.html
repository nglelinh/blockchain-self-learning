<h1 id="lecture-ethereum-architecture---world-computer-platform">Lecture: Ethereum Architecture - World Computer Platform</h1>

<h2 id="1-tổng-quan-về-khái-niệm">1. Tổng quan về khái niệm</h2>

<p><strong>Ethereum</strong> không chỉ là một cryptocurrency - nó là một <strong>decentralized world computer</strong>, một platform cho phép bất kỳ ai deploy và run <strong>smart contracts</strong> (chương trình tự động thực thi) trên một global network. Nếu Bitcoin là “digital gold” hay “peer-to-peer cash”, thì Ethereum là “programmable money” và “decentralized application platform”.</p>

<p><strong>The Vision - Vitalik Buterin’s Insight</strong>:</p>

<p>Vào năm 2013, <strong>Vitalik Buterin</strong> - một programmer 19 tuổi involved trong Bitcoin community - nhận ra một limitation fundamental: Bitcoin’s Script language quá limited. Nó có thể handle simple “if this then that” logic, nhưng không thể run complex computations. Vitalik đề xuất thêm Turing-complete programming language vào Bitcoin, nhưng proposal bị reject.</p>

<p>Vậy nên năm 2013, ông viết <strong>Ethereum Whitepaper</strong>: “A Next-Generation Smart Contract and Decentralized Application Platform”. Key insight:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“What blockchain needs is a built-in Turing-complete programming language that allows anyone to write smart contracts and decentralized applications where they can create their own arbitrary rules for ownership, transaction formats and state transition functions.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Smart Contracts - The Core Innovation</strong>:</p>

<p>Term “smart contract” được đề xuất bởi <strong>Nick Szabo</strong> năm 1994, nhưng Ethereum là first platform successfully implement concept này at scale:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Traditional Contract:
- Written in legal language
- Enforced by legal system
- Requires trusted intermediaries
- Slow, expensive, subjective interpretation

Smart Contract:
- Written in programming language (Solidity, Vyper)
- Enforced by blockchain consensus
- No intermediaries needed
- Instant, cheap, deterministic execution
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Example - Vending Machine Analogy</strong>:</p>

<p>Nick Szabo’s famous analogy: Smart contract giống như vending machine:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Traditional Purchase:
1. Go to store
2. Find clerk
3. Ask for item
4. Clerk gets item
5. Pay clerk
6. Clerk gives item
(Requires trust in clerk)

Vending Machine (Smart Contract):
1. Insert money
2. Press button
3. Get item automatically
(No trust needed - machine enforces rules)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Ethereum extends this: Bất kỳ programmable rule nào có thể become a “vending machine”!</p>

<p><strong>Ethereum’s Architecture Philosophy</strong>:</p>

<p>Ethereum được thiết kế với principles:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Simplicity</strong>: Protocol đơn giản nhất có thể</li>
  <li><strong>Universality</strong>: Turing-complete language</li>
  <li><strong>Modularity</strong>: Separate consensus from execution</li>
  <li><strong>Agility</strong>: Protocol có thể upgrade</li>
  <li><strong>Non-discrimination</strong>: No built-in applications</li>
  <li><strong>Non-censorship</strong>: No transaction censorship</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="21-ethereum-như-world-computer">2.1. Ethereum như “World Computer”</h3>

<p>Hãy tưởng tượng Ethereum như một <strong>giant global computer</strong>:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Traditional Cloud Computing:
- Run app on AWS, Google Cloud, etc.
- Trust company to not shut down
- Company can censor, change rules
- Centralized control

Ethereum "World Computer":
- Run app on thousands of nodes globally
- Cannot be shut down (decentralized)
- Rules enforced by code, not company
- Censorship-resistant
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Components</strong>:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Hardware: Thousands of Ethereum nodes (computers running client)
CPU: EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) processes transactions
RAM: State (account balances, contract storage)
Hard Drive: Blockchain (permanent history)
Operating System: Ethereum protocol rules
Programs: Smart contracts
Users: External accounts sending transactions
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Cost Model</strong>:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>AWS: Pay per hour/month for resources
Ethereum: Pay per computation (Gas fees)

Example:
- Store 32 bytes: ~20,000 gas (~$0.50 at 50 gwei)
- Complex computation: 100,000 gas (~$2.50)
- Simple transfer: 21,000 gas (~$0.50)
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="22-account-model-vs-utxo---bank-account-vs-cash">2.2. Account Model vs UTXO - Bank Account vs Cash</h3>

<p><strong>Bitcoin UTXO (Cash Model)</strong>:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Alice has:
- $50 bill
- $20 bill
- $10 bill
Total: $80

To pay Bob $60:
- Use $50 + $20 bills
- Bob gets $60 in new bills
- Alice gets $10 change
- Old bills destroyed

Advantages: Privacy, parallel processing
Disadvantages: Complex to track "balance"
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Ethereum Account (Bank Account Model)</strong>:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Alice's account: $80
Bob's account: $40

To pay Bob $60:
- Alice account: $80 → $20
- Bob account: $40 → $100
- Simple deduction/addition

Advantages: Simple, intuitive, easy to track balance
Disadvantages: Less privacy, sequential processing
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="23-smart-contract-như-vending-machine-program">2.3. Smart Contract như “Vending Machine Program”</h3>

<p><strong>Simple Smart Contract Example</strong> (conceptual):</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Contract: CrowdfundingCampaign
State:
  - Goal: 100 ETH
  - Deadline: Dec 31, 2024
  - Total raised: 0 ETH
  - Contributors: {}

Functions:
  contribute():
    - Accept ETH from sender
    - Add to total raised
    - Record contributor

  checkGoal():
    - If deadline passed:
      - If goal reached:
        → Send all ETH to project owner
      - If goal not reached:
        → Refund everyone automatically

No human intervention needed!
Rules enforced by code!
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Real-World Impact</strong>:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Traditional Crowdfunding (Kickstarter):
- Platform takes 5% fee
- Can freeze/cancel campaign
- Refunds manual, slow
- Geographic restrictions

Smart Contract Crowdfunding:
- No platform fee (only gas)
- Cannot be censored
- Refunds automatic, instant
- Global, permissionless
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="24-gas-system---computational-postage-stamps">2.4. Gas System - “Computational Postage Stamps”</h3>

<p><strong>Problem</strong>: Nếu computation free, attackers có thể spam network với infinite loops!</p>

<p><strong>Solution: Gas</strong> - pay per computation</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Analogy: Postage stamps
- Want to send letter? Buy stamp
- Heavier letter? More stamps
- More complex computation? More gas

Gas Pricing:
Operation          Gas Cost
---------------------------------
ADD two numbers    3 gas
MULTIPLY           5 gas
Store 32 bytes     20,000 gas
Create contract    32,000 gas
Transfer ETH       21,000 gas

User sets:
- Gas Limit: Max gas willing to spend
- Gas Price: How much per gas (in gwei)

Total Fee = Gas Used × Gas Price
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Example Transaction</strong>:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Send 1 ETH to friend:
- Gas used: 21,000
- Gas price: 50 gwei (0.00000005 ETH)
- Fee: 21,000 × 50 = 1,050,000 gwei = 0.00105 ETH

At $2,000/ETH: Fee = $2.10
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="25-evm---global-sandbox-computer">2.5. EVM - “Global Sandbox Computer”</h3>

<p><strong>Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)</strong> như một <strong>giant sandboxed computer</strong>:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Sandbox Properties:
✓ Deterministic: Same input → Same output (always)
✓ Isolated: Cannot access external world directly
✓ Metered: Every operation costs gas
✓ Reversible: Failed transactions rollback completely

Why Sandbox?
- Security: Malicious code can't harm nodes
- Consensus: All nodes compute same result
- Fairness: No one gets free computation
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Stack Machine</strong>:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>EVM operates like calculator with stack:

Example: Compute 2 + 3 × 4

Stack operations:
1. PUSH 2    → [2]
2. PUSH 3    → [2, 3]
3. PUSH 4    → [2, 3, 4]
4. MUL       → [2, 12]      (3 × 4)
5. ADD       → [14]          (2 + 12)

Result: 14
