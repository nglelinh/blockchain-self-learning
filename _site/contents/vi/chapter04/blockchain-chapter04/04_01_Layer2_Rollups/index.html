    Lecture 04.01: Layer 2 Solutions - Rollups Deep Dive
    
  </h1>
  <h1 id="lecture-layer-2-solutions---rollups-deep-dive">Lecture: Layer 2 Solutions - Rollups Deep Dive</h1>

<h2 id="1-tổng-quan-về-khái-niệm">1. Tổng quan về khái niệm</h2>

<p><strong>Rollups</strong> đã emerge như <strong>primary scaling solution</strong> cho Ethereum, được chính Vitalik Buterin endorse trong “rollup-centric roadmap”. Rollups execute transactions off-chain nhưng post transaction data lên Layer 1, inheriting Ethereum’s security trong khi achieving 10-100× throughput improvement.</p>

<p><strong>Core Concept</strong>:</p>

<p>Thay vì execute mọi transaction trên Ethereum mainnet (expensive, slow), rollups:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Execute off-chain</strong>: Process thousands of transactions off Ethereum</li>
  <li><strong>Batch results</strong>: Combine nhiều transactions thành một batch</li>
  <li><strong>Post to L1</strong>: Submit compressed data + proof lên Ethereum</li>
  <li><strong>Inherit security</strong>: Protected by Ethereum’s consensus</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>The Rollup Promise</strong>:</p>

<p>[
\text{Security(Rollup)} = \text{Security(Ethereum L1)}
]
[
\text{TPS(Rollup)} = \text{TPS(Ethereum)} \times 10-100
]
[
\text{Cost(Rollup)} = \frac{\text{Cost(Ethereum)}}{10-100}
]</p>

<p>Best of both worlds!</p>

<p><strong>Two Main Types</strong>:</p>

<p><strong>Optimistic Rollups</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Assume transactions valid (optimistic)</li>
  <li>Allow fraud proofs (challenge if invalid)</li>
  <li>7-day withdrawal delay</li>
  <li>Examples: Arbitrum, Optimism</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>ZK-Rollups</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Generate validity proofs (cryptographic)</li>
  <li>Mathematically proven valid</li>
  <li>Instant withdrawals</li>
  <li>Examples: zkSync, StarkNet, Polygon zkEVM</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Historical Development</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>2014</strong>: Plasma concept (Vitalik &amp; Joseph Poon)</li>
  <li><strong>2018</strong>: Optimistic Rollup proposal</li>
  <li><strong>2019</strong>: ZK-Rollup concept matures</li>
  <li><strong>2020</strong>: First rollups launch on testnet</li>
  <li><strong>2021</strong>: Production rollups (Arbitrum, Optimism)</li>
  <li><strong>2022</strong>: ZK-EVM rollups (zkSync 2.0, Polygon zkEVM)</li>
  <li><strong>2023-2024</strong>: Rollup wars - competition for users</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Why Rollups Won</strong>:</p>

<p>Other scaling approaches failed or limited:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>State channels</strong>: Complex UX, liquidity requirements</li>
  <li><strong>Plasma</strong>: Data availability issues</li>
  <li><strong>Sidechains</strong>: Separate security assumptions</li>
  <li><strong>Sharding</strong>: Implementation complexity</li>
</ul>

<p>Rollups succeeded because:</p>
<ul>
  <li>✅ Inherit L1 security (no separate validator set)</li>
  <li>✅ Relatively simple to implement</li>
  <li>✅ EVM compatibility possible</li>
  <li>✅ Strong theoretical foundation</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="21-rollup-như-batch-processing">2.1. Rollup như “Batch Processing”</h3>

<p><strong>Individual Processing</strong> (Ethereum L1):</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Customer Service Center:
- 1000 customers
- Each gets individual appointment
- Each takes 10 minutes
- Total time: 10,000 minutes (7 days!)
- Cost: $50 per customer = $50,000

Slow, expensive, but every case handled personally
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Batch Processing</strong> (Rollup):</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Batch Service:
- Same 1000 customers
- Group into batches of 100
- Process batch together
- Each batch: 30 minutes
- Total time: 300 minutes (5 hours!)
- Cost: $5 per customer = $5,000

10× faster, 10× cheaper!
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Rollup Analogy</strong>:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>L1: Each transaction processed individually on Ethereum
    └─ Gas: ~21,000 per simple transfer
    └─ Cost: $5-50 depending on congestion

Rollup: Batch 100 transactions
    └─ Gas on L1: ~100,000 total (amortized)
    └─ Gas per TX: ~1,000
    └─ Cost: $0.50-5 per transaction
    
10× improvement!
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="22-optimistic-vs-zk---trust-vs-verify">2.2. Optimistic vs ZK - “Trust vs Verify”</h3>

<p><strong>Optimistic Rollup</strong> = <strong>“Trust but Verify Later”</strong>:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Tax Return Analogy:

You submit tax return:
└─ Government assumes correct (optimistic)
└─ Don't verify immediately (save resources)
└─ Anyone can challenge within timeframe (7 days)
└─ If challenged: Audit happens
└─ If fraud found: Penalties!

Most returns honest → System efficient!
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>ZK-Rollup</strong> = <strong>“Cryptographic Proof Upfront”</strong>:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Airport Security Analogy:

You go through security:
└─ X-ray scan (proof)
└─ Proves: "No weapons" without opening every bag
└─ Mathematical guarantee
└─ No trust needed
└─ Instant verification

Every passenger verified → System secure!
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Comparison</strong>:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Optimistic:
✓ Simpler to implement
✓ Full EVM compatibility
✗ 7-day withdrawal delay
✗ Fraud proof complexity

ZK:
✓ Instant finality
✓ Higher throughput
✗ Complex cryptography
✗ Limited EVM compatibility (improving)
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="23-data-availability---receipts-problem">2.3. Data Availability - “Receipts Problem”</h3>

<p><strong>The Problem</strong>:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Rollup posts to L1:
"I processed 1000 transactions, new state root: 0xABC..."

But if transaction data not available:
└─ Cannot verify state transition
└─ Cannot reconstruct state
└─ Cannot withdraw funds!

Like: Restaurant gives you receipt
     But receipt illegible
     Can't prove what you ordered!
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Solution</strong>: Post all transaction data to L1 as <strong>calldata</strong></p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Calldata:
✓ Permanent (stored on Ethereum forever)
✓ Cheaper than storage (~16 gas/byte vs 20,000/slot)
✓ Anyone can download
✓ Can reconstruct full state

Trade-off: Still costs gas (limits compression)
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="24-fraud-proofs---challenge-system">2.4. Fraud Proofs - “Challenge System”</h3>

<p><strong>Optimistic Rollup Challenge</strong>:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Normal flow:
1. Sequencer posts batch
2. Validators assume valid
3. Wait 7 days
4. If no challenge → Finalize

Challenge flow:
1. Validator detects invalid state transition
2. Submits fraud proof to L1
3. L1 re-executes disputed transaction
4. If fraud proven:
   → Sequencer slashed
   → State reverted
   → Challenger rewarded

Incentive: Profitable to catch fraud!
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Game Theory</strong>:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Sequencer decision:
- Honest: Earn fees
- Cheat: Lose stake (&gt;fees earned)

Rational choice: Be honest!

Validator decision:
- Monitor: Earn bounty if find fraud
- Ignore: Miss reward opportunity

Rational choice: Monitor actively!
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="25-validity-proofs---mathematical-guarantee">2.5. Validity Proofs - “Mathematical Guarantee”</h3>

<p><strong>ZK-SNARK Proof</strong>:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Claim: "These 1000 transactions are valid"

Without ZK:
└─ Must re-execute all 1000 TX
└─ Takes significant time/gas
└─ Must trust executor

With ZK:
└─ Generate proof (off-chain): "Execution correct"
└─ Proof size: ~128 bytes
└─ Verify proof (on-chain): ~1ms, minimal gas
└─ Mathematical guarantee: Cannot fake proof

Like: Professor grades 1000 exams
     Provides summary + cryptographic proof
     You verify proof in seconds (don't re-grade!)

<p><strong>L1 Ethereum Throughput</strong>:</p>

<p>[
\text{TPS}_{\text{L1}} = \frac{\text{Block Gas Limit}}{\text{Gas per TX} \times \text{Block Time}} = \frac{30M}{21000 \times 12} \approx 119 \text{ TPS}
]</p>

<p>(Actual: ~15-30 TPS due to complex transactions)</p>

<p><strong>Rollup Throughput</strong>:</p>

<p>[
\text{TPS}_{\text{rollup}} = \frac{\text{Block Gas Limit} / n}{\text{Calldata per TX} \times \text{Block Time}}
]</p>

<p>Where ( n ) = number of competing rollups</p>

<p><strong>Example (Optimistic Rollup)</strong>:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Assume 1 rollup uses full block:
- TX data: 12 bytes per TX (compressed)
- Calldata cost: 16 gas per byte
- Gas per TX: 12 × 16 = 192 gas

TPS = 30M / (192 × 12) = 13,020 TPS

Improvement: 13,020 / 15 ≈ 868× better!
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>With EIP-4844</strong> (Proto-Danksharding):</p>

<p>[
\text{TPS}_{\text{blob}} = \frac{\text{Blob Space}}{\text{Bytes per TX} \times \text{Block Time}}

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Blob space: ~125 KB per block
Block time: 12s

TPS = 125,000 / (12 × 12) = 868 TPS per rollup

With 100 rollups: 868 × 100 = 86,800 TPS!

<h3 id="42-cost-analysis">4.2. Cost Analysis</h3>

<p><strong>L1 Transaction Cost</strong>:</p>

<p><strong>Rollup Transaction Cost</strong>:</p>

<p>[

<p><strong>Optimistic Rollup</strong>:</p>

Gas: 12,000 × 16 = 192,000 gas

Per TX: $19.20 / 1000 = $0.0192 (~2 cents)

Savings: $2.10 / $0.0192 = 109× cheaper!

<p><strong>ZK-Rollup</strong> (better compression):</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Batch: 1000 transactions

Proof verification: ~500,000 gas (one-time)
Gas: 5,000 × 16 + 500,000 = 580,000 gas
Cost: 580,000 × 50 gwei × $2000 = $58
