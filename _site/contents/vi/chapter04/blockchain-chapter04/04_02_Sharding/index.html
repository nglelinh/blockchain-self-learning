    Lecture 04.02: Sharding - Parallel Blockchain Processing
    
  </h1>
  <h1 id="lecture-sharding---parallel-blockchain-processing">Lecture: Sharding - Parallel Blockchain Processing</h1>

<h2 id="1-tổng-quan-về-khái-niệm">1. Tổng quan về khái niệm</h2>

<p><strong>Sharding</strong> là technique chia blockchain network thành multiple parallel chains (shards), mỗi shard processing một subset của transactions. Đây là một trong những ambitious scaling solutions, promising linear scalability: 64 shards = 64× throughput!</p>

<p><strong>Database Sharding Origin</strong>:</p>

<p>Sharding không phải concept mới - nó được sử dụng rộng rãi trong traditional databases:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Traditional Database:
- Single server: 10,000 queries/second
- Problem: Cannot handle more load

Sharded Database:
- Split data across 10 servers
- Each handles different data subset
- Total: 100,000 queries/second
- 10× improvement!
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Blockchain Sharding Challenge</strong>:</p>

<p>Database sharding đơn giản hơn vì có central coordinator. Blockchain sharding phức tạp hơn nhiều:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Database Sharding:
✓ Central coordinator assigns data
✓ Trust database admin
✓ Can communicate between shards easily

Blockchain Sharding:
✗ Must maintain decentralization
✗ Must handle cross-shard transactions
✗ Must prevent single-shard attacks
✗ Must ensure data availability
✗ More complex consensus
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>The Vision</strong> (Ethereum Sharding):</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Current Ethereum:
- 1 chain
- All validators process ALL transactions
- Throughput: ~15 TPS
- Bottleneck: Every node does everything

Sharded Ethereum:
- 64 shards + 1 beacon chain
- Validators assigned to specific shards
- Each shard: ~15 TPS
- Total: 64 × 15 = 960 TPS base
- With rollups: 960 × 100 = 96,000 TPS!

64× on-chain improvement!
10,000× với rollups!
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Evolution of Ethereum’s Sharding Plan</strong>:</p>

<p><strong>Phase 1</strong> (Original, 2017-2020):</p>
<ul>
  <li>1024 shards</li>
  <li>Full execution sharding</li>
  <li>Extremely complex</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Phase 2</strong> (Simplified, 2020-2022):</p>
<ul>
  <li>64 data shards</li>
  <li>Execution via rollups</li>
  <li>“Rollup-centric roadmap”</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Phase 3</strong> (Current, Danksharding, 2022-2024):</p>
<ul>
  <li>Merged sharding design</li>
  <li>Proto-Danksharding (EIP-4844) first</li>
  <li>Full Danksharding later</li>
  <li>Focus: Data availability for rollups</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="21-sharding-như-parallel-checkout-lanes">2.1. Sharding như “Parallel Checkout Lanes”</h3>

<p><strong>Single Lane</strong> (Current blockchain):</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Supermarket:
- 1 checkout lane
- 1000 customers
- Each takes 1 minute
- Total time: 1000 minutes (~17 hours!)

Everyone waits in same line
Slow but fair
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Sharded</strong> (Multiple lanes):</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Supermarket:
- 10 checkout lanes (shards)
- 1000 customers
- Distributed across lanes
- Total time: 100 minutes (~1.7 hours!)

10× faster!
But: Must ensure fair distribution
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Challenge</strong>: Cross-lane transactions</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Customer 1 in Lane A wants to split payment with Customer 2 in Lane B
→ Lanes must coordinate!
→ Adds complexity
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="22-beacon-chain-như-traffic-controller">2.2. Beacon Chain như “Traffic Controller”</h3>

<p><strong>Ethereum Sharding Architecture</strong>:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>        Beacon Chain (Coordinator)
              /    |    \
             /     |     \
            /      |      \
      Shard 0  Shard 1 ... Shard 63
      
Beacon Chain:
- Coordinates validators
- Assigns validators to shards
- Maintains finality
- Handles cross-shard messages

Shards:
- Process transactions independently
- Report to Beacon Chain
- Receive cross-shard messages
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Analogy</strong>: Air traffic control</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Air Traffic Control = Beacon Chain
- Coordinates all planes (shards)
- Ensures no collisions
- Manages communication

Individual planes = Shards  
- Fly independently
- Report to control
- Follow coordination
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="23-data-availability-sampling">2.3. Data Availability Sampling</h3>

<p><strong>The Problem</strong>:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Sharded data:
- Too much for single node to download
- Need to verify data available
- Without downloading everything

Like: Library với millions of books
     Want to verify all books exist
     Without reading every book!
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Solution: Random Sampling</strong>:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Data Availability Sampling (DAS):

1. Data split into chunks
2. Node randomly samples k chunks
3. If all samples valid and available:
   → High probability ALL data available
4. Repeat sampling multiple times

Math: With 1% missing data
     Sampling 30 chunks
     → 99.9% chance detect missing data

Efficient verification!
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="24-cross-shard-communication">2.4. Cross-Shard Communication</h3>

<p><strong>The Challenge</strong>:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Alice (Shard 0): Has 100 tokens
Bob (Shard 1): Address receiving tokens

Transaction: Alice → Bob (100 tokens)

Problem:
- Alice's balance on Shard 0
- Bob's balance on Shard 1
- How to coordinate?
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Solutions</strong>:</p>

<p><strong>Approach 1: Receipts</strong></p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>1. Shard 0: Deduct 100 from Alice
2. Shard 0: Create receipt: "100 tokens for Shard 1"
3. Receipt posted to Beacon Chain
4. Shard 1: Reads receipt
5. Shard 1: Credit 100 to Bob

Atomic: Either both happen or neither
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Approach 2: Locking</strong></p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>1. Lock Alice's 100 tokens on Shard 0
2. Create proof of lock
3. Shard 1 verifies proof
4. Credit Bob on Shard 1
5. Burn locked tokens on Shard 0

Two-phase commit across shards
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="25-validator-assignment">2.5. Validator Assignment</h3>

<p><strong>Random Assignment</strong> (critical for security):</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Security threat: If attacker controls validator assignment
└─ Could assign all malicious validators to one shard
└─ Take over that shard!

Solution: Random unpredictable assignment
└─ Validator rotation every epoch
└─ Reshuffling prevents coordination
└─ Based on RANDAO (VDF)

Result: Attacker must control &gt;1/3 of TOTAL stake
       (not just shard stake)

<p><strong>Without Sharding</strong>:</p>

\text{TPS}<em>{\text{total}} = \text{TPS}</em>{\text{single chain}}

<p><strong>With Sharding</strong>:</p>

<p>[
\text{TPS}<em>{\text{total}} = n \times \text{TPS}</em>{\text{per shard}}

<p>Where ( n ) = number of shards</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Single chain: 15 TPS
64 shards: 64 × 15 = 960 TPS

Linear scaling!
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>With Rollups on Shards</strong>:</p>

<p>[
\text{TPS}<em>{\text{total}} = n</em>{\text{shards}} \times m_{\text{rollups/shard}} \times \text{TPS}_{\text{rollup}}

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>64 shards × 10 rollups/shard × 100 TPS/rollup

<h3 id="42-security-analysis---single-shard-attack">4.2. Security Analysis - Single Shard Attack</h3>

<p><strong>Corrupt One Shard Probability</strong>:</p>

<p>Với ( n ) shards, ( m ) validators/shard, attacker controls ( \alpha ) fraction:</p>

<p>[
P(\text{corrupt ≥1 shard}) = 1 - \left(1 - P(\text{corrupt single shard})\right)^n
]</p>

<p><strong>Corrupt Single Shard</strong>:</p>

<p>Need ( \geq 2/3 ) of shard’s validators.</p>

<p>Using binomial distribution:</p>

<p>[
P(\text{corrupt shard}) = \sum_{k=\lceil 2m/3 \rceil}^{m} \binom{m}{k} \alpha^k (1-\alpha)^{m-k}
]</p>

<p><strong>Example Calculation</strong>:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Total validators: 10,000
Shards: 64
Validators per shard: 10,000 / 64 ≈ 156
Attacker stake: 10%

P(control 2/3 of one shard):
Using normal approximation:
≈ Φ((0.1 - 0.667) / √(0.1×0.9/156))
≈ Φ(-23.5)
≈ 10^-122 (essentially impossible!)

With 64 shards:
P(corrupt ≥1) ≈ 64 × 10^-122 ≈ 10^-120

Still impossible!
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Security Requirement</strong>:</p>

<p>[
m \geq \frac{9\log(n)}{\epsilon^2} \quad \text{for security parameter } \epsilon
]</p>

<p>More shards → need more validators per shard!</p>

<h3 id="43-cross-shard-latency">4.3. Cross-Shard Latency</h3>

<p><strong>Cross-Shard Transaction Time</strong>:</p>

<p>[
T_{\text{cross-shard}} = T_{\text{shard1}} + T_{\text{beacon}} + T_{\text{shard2}}
]</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Shard 1 processes: 1 slot (12 seconds)
Beacon includes receipt: 1 slot (12 seconds)
Shard 2 processes receipt: 1 slot (12 seconds)

Total: 36 seconds (vs 12s for same-shard)

3× slower for cross-shard!
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Optimization</strong>: Asynchronous cross-shard</p>
<ul>
  <li>Don’t wait for immediate confirmation</li>
  <li>Process in background</li>
  <li>Similar to eventual consistency</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="44-data-availability-sampling-math">4.4. Data Availability Sampling Math</h3>

<p><strong>Problem</strong>: Verify ( N ) chunks available without downloading all</p>

<p><strong>Solution</strong>: Random sample ( k ) chunks</p>

<p><strong>Detection Probability</strong>:</p>

<p>If ( p ) fraction of data missing:</p>

<p>[
P(\text{detect}) = 1 - (1 - p)^k
]</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Missing data: p = 1% (1% chunks unavailable)
Sample size: k = 30 chunks

P(detect) = 1 - (0.99)^30
          = 1 - 0.74
          = 0.26 = 26%

Not great! Need more samples.

With k = 100:
P(detect) = 1 - (0.99)^100 = 1 - 0.366 = 63.4%

With k = 300:
P(detect) = 1 - (0.99)^300 = 95%

Trade-off: More samples = better detection but higher cost
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Erasure Coding</strong>:</p>

<p>Expand data with redundancy:</p>

<p>[
\text{Expanded Data} = \text{Original} \times (1 + r)
]</p>

<p>Where ( r ) = redundancy factor</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Original: 100 chunks
Redundancy: 50% (r = 0.5)
Expanded: 150 chunks

Property: Can reconstruct original from ANY 100 of 150 chunks

Even if 50 chunks missing → Can recover!
