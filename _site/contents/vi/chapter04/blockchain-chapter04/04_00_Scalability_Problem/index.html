    Lecture 04.00: Blockchain Scalability - The Trilemma và Solutions
    
  </h1>
  <h1 id="lecture-blockchain-scalability---the-trilemma-và-solutions">Lecture: Blockchain Scalability - The Trilemma và Solutions</h1>

<h2 id="1-tổng-quan-về-khái-niệm">1. Tổng quan về khái niệm</h2>

<p><strong>Scalability</strong> là arguably the biggest challenge facing blockchain technology today. Trong khi traditional payment systems như Visa process ~24,000 transactions/second (TPS), Bitcoin chỉ handle ~7 TPS và Ethereum ~15-30 TPS. Đây là <strong>orders of magnitude slower</strong> - một bottleneck fundamental nếu blockchain muốn achieve mass adoption.</p>

<p><strong>The Blockchain Trilemma</strong>:</p>

<p>Term được coin bởi <strong>Vitalik Buterin</strong>, blockchain trilemma states rằng một blockchain system chỉ có thể optimize tối đa 2 trong 3 properties sau:</p>

<p><strong>1. Decentralization (Phi tập trung)</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Number of nodes participating</li>
  <li>No single point of control</li>
  <li>Anyone can join network</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>2. Security (Bảo mật)</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Resistance to attacks</li>
  <li>Economic cost to compromise</li>
  <li>Byzantine fault tolerance</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>3. Scalability (Khả năng mở rộng)</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Transaction throughput (TPS)</li>
  <li>Low latency (confirmation time)</li>
  <li>Low cost per transaction</li>
</ul>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>        Decentralization
             /  \
            /    \
           /  ⚠️  \
          /________\
    Security        Scalability
    
You can only have 2 of 3!

Bitcoin: Decentralization + Security → Low Scalability
Private chains: Security + Scalability → Low Decentralization
Some altcoins: Scalability + Decentralization → Questionable Security
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Why The Trilemma Exists</strong>:</p>

<p><strong>Fundamental Constraints</strong>:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Bandwidth</strong>: Each node must receive all transactions
[
\text{Bandwidth Required} = \text{TPS} \times \text{Avg TX Size} \times 8 \text{ bits/byte}
]</p>

    <p>For 10,000 TPS:
[
10000 \times 250 \text{ bytes} \times 8 = 20 \text{ Mbps minimum}
]</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Storage</strong>: Each full node stores entire blockchain
[
\text{Growth Rate} = \text{TPS} \times \text{Avg TX Size} \times 86400 \text{ seconds/day}
]</p>

    <p>For 10,000 TPS:
[
10000 \times 250 \times 86400 = 216 \text{ GB/day!}
]</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Computation</strong>: Each node validates all transactions
[
\text{CPU Required} \propto \text{TPS} \times \text{Validation Cost}
]</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Historical Scaling Attempts</strong>:</p>

<p><strong>2015-2017</strong>: The Block Size Wars (Bitcoin)</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Small blocks (1 MB):
✓ More nodes can participate (decentralization)
✓ Easier to verify (security)
✗ Only ~7 TPS (scalability)

Big blocks (8+ MB):
✓ More TPS (~56+) (scalability)
✗ Fewer can run full nodes (centralization)
✗ Longer validation time

Result: Bitcoin Cash hard fork (2017)
        Bitcoin kept 1MB base, added SegWit
        BCH went to 8MB → 32MB → 128MB
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>2017-2020</strong>: Layer 2 Emergence</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Lightning Network (Bitcoin):
- Off-chain payment channels
- Instant, cheap transactions
- Sacrifice some decentralization

Plasma, State Channels (Ethereum):
- Various Layer 2 approaches
- Different trust assumptions
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>2020-present</strong>: Rollup-Centric Roadmap</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Ethereum's strategy:
- Layer 1: Security and decentralization
- Layer 2: Scalability (rollups)
- Best of both worlds?
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="2-hiểu-biết-trực-quan">2. Hiểu biết trực quan</h2>

<h3 id="21-scalability-problem---highway-analogy">2.1. Scalability Problem - Highway Analogy</h3>

<p><strong>Bitcoin/Ethereum</strong> = <strong>Narrow Highway</strong>:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Highway Capacity:
- Lanes: 1 (block size)
- Cars per minute: 7 (TPS)
- Everyone sees all cars (transparency)
- Very secure road (attack-resistant)

During rush hour:
- Huge traffic jam!
- Wait hours to get on highway
- Expensive toll (high fees)
- But very safe, anyone can use
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Visa</strong> = <strong>Private Superhighway</strong>:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Highway Capacity:
- Lanes: 1000 (centralized servers)
- Cars per minute: 24,000 (TPS)
- Only Visa sees traffic (no transparency)
- Single company controls

Benefits:
- No traffic jams
- Instant processing
- Cheap tolls

Drawbacks:
- Visa can block you
- Single point of failure
- Must trust Visa
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Challenge</strong>: Can we build a highway that’s BOTH decentralized AND high-throughput?</p>

<h3 id="22-layer-2-như-express-lanes">2.2. Layer 2 như “Express Lanes”</h3>

<p><strong>Layer 1</strong> (Main chain) = <strong>Main Highway</strong>:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Slow but secure
Everyone can verify
Expensive
Permanent record
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Layer 2</strong> (Rollups, Lightning) = <strong>Express Lanes Above Highway</strong>:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Fast transactions
Still secured by main highway
Cheap
Periodic checkpoints to main chain
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Analogy</strong>:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Main Highway (Layer 1):
- Every car recorded individually
- Full security checks
- Slow but thorough

Express Lane (Layer 2):
- Bundle 100 cars → 1 record on main highway
- Fast processing
- Still protected by main highway security
- Checkpoints ensure safety
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="23-state-channels---tab-system">2.3. State Channels - “Tab System”</h3>

<p><strong>Lightning Network</strong> như <strong>bar tab</strong>:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Traditional (On-chain):
Every beer purchase:
- Transaction on blockchain
- Wait for confirmation
- Pay fee
Total: 10 beers = 10 transactions = 10 fees

Lightning (State Channel):
1. Open tab (on-chain): Lock $100
2. Buy 10 beers (off-chain): Instant, free
3. Close tab (on-chain): Final settlement
Total: 10 beers = 2 on-chain transactions only!

Savings: 80% less blockchain usage!
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>How It Works</strong>:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Alice ←→ Bob (payment channel)

Open channel:
- Both deposit funds in 2-of-2 multisig
- On-chain transaction

Transact (off-chain):
- Update channel balance
- Sign new state
- Can go back and forth unlimited times
- Instant, no fees

Close channel:
- Broadcast final state
- On-chain transaction
- Both receive final balances
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="24-rollups---batch-processing">2.4. Rollups - “Batch Processing”</h3>

<p><strong>Optimistic Rollups</strong> như <strong>monthly credit card statement</strong>:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Individual Transactions (Layer 1):
- Every purchase separately verified
- Slow, expensive

Credit Card Statement (Rollup):
- Batch 1000 purchases
- Assume valid (optimistic)
- Publish summary to blockchain
- Challenge period: Can dispute if wrong

Result: 1000 transactions → 1 blockchain entry!
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>ZK-Rollups</strong> như <strong>mathematical proof of batch</strong>:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Batch 1000 transactions
Generate cryptographic proof: "These 1000 TXs are valid"
Post proof + summary to blockchain
Blockchain verifies proof (fast!)

No need to check each transaction!
Proof guarantees validity!
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="25-sharding---database-partitioning">2.5. Sharding - “Database Partitioning”</h3>

<p><strong>Sharding</strong> như <strong>splitting database across servers</strong>:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Traditional Blockchain:
All nodes process ALL transactions
└─ Node 1: TX 1, 2, 3, 4, 5...
└─ Node 2: TX 1, 2, 3, 4, 5...
└─ Node 3: TX 1, 2, 3, 4, 5...

Sharded Blockchain:
Nodes specialized per shard
└─ Shard A nodes: TX 1, 3, 5...
└─ Shard B nodes: TX 2, 4, 6...
└─ Beacon chain: Coordinates shards

Throughput: 2× with 2 shards, 64× with 64 shards!
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Transaction Processing Limit</strong>:</p>

<p>[
\text{TPS}_{\max} = \frac{\text{Block Size}}{\text{Avg TX Size} \times \text{Block Time}}
]</p>

<p><strong>Bitcoin</strong>:
[
\text{TPS} = \frac{1 \text{ MB}}{250 \text{ bytes} \times 600 \text{ s}} = \frac{1,000,000}{150,000} \approx 7 \text{ TPS}
]</p>

<p><strong>Ethereum</strong> (pre-merge):
[
\text{TPS} = \frac{15M \text{ gas}}{21000 \text{ gas/TX} \times 13 \text{ s}} \approx 55 \text{ TPS}
]</p>

<p>(Actually lower ~15-30 TPS due to complex transactions)</p>

<p><strong>Multi-Hop Routing</strong> (HTLC):</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Alice wants to pay David, but no direct channel

Route: Alice → Bob → Charlie → David

1. David creates secret preimage: R, hash H = hash(R)
2. David sends H to Alice
3. Alice → Bob: "I'll pay 10 if you show R within 24h"
4. Bob → Charlie: "I'll pay 10 if you show R within 12h"
5. Charlie → David: "I'll pay 10 if you show R within 6h"
6. David reveals R to Charlie (gets 10)
7. Charlie reveals R to Bob (gets 10)
8. Bob reveals R to Alice (gets 10)
9. Alice verifies R matches H ✓

<p><strong>Theoretical Maximum TPS</strong>:</p>

<p>[

<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
  <li>( B_{\max} ) = Maximum block size (bytes)</li>
  <li>( T_{\min} ) = Minimum block time (seconds)</li>
  <li>( S_{\text{avg}} ) = Average transaction size (bytes)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>With Rollups</strong>:</p>

<p>[
\text{TPS}<em>{\text{rollup}} = \text{TPS}</em>{\text{L1}} \times \frac{S_{\text{L1 TX}}}{S_{\text{compressed}}}
]</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Ethereum L1: 15 TPS, 110 bytes/TX

Rollup compression: 10 bytes/TX (90% reduction)

TPS_rollup = 15 × (110 / 10) = 165 TPS

Compressed: 10 bytes each
State root: 32 bytes

Data = 1000 × 10 + 32 = 10,032 bytes

Posted to L1:
Cost = 10,032 bytes × 16 gas/byte = 160,512 gas
At 50 gwei: ~0.008 ETH (~$16 at $2000/ETH)

<h3 id="44-sharding-security-analysis">4.4. Sharding Security Analysis</h3>

<p><strong>Corruption Threshold</strong>:</p>

<p>Với ( n ) shards, attacker với fraction ( \alpha ) của total stake:</p>

<p><strong>Probability of corrupting ≥1 shard</strong>:</p>

<p>[
P(\text{corrupt}) = 1 - \left(1 - \alpha^{m}\right)^n
]</p>

<p>Where ( m ) = validators per shard</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Total validators: 10,000
Shards: 64
Validators per shard: 10,000 / 64 ≈ 156
Attacker stake: 10%

P(control 1 shard) = (0.1)^156 ≈ 10^-156 (virtually impossible)

But with random assignment:
Need 2/3 of shard validators
P(2/3 of 156) = ...calculating via binomial distribution...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Security Tradeoff</strong>:
More shards → Higher throughput → Smaller validator sets → Lower security per shard!</p>

<h3 id="45-rollup-cost-savings">4.5. Rollup Cost Savings</h3>

<p><strong>Cost Reduction Factor</strong>:</p>

<p>[
R = \frac{\text{Cost}<em>{\text{L1}}}{\text{Cost}</em>{\text{L2}}} = \frac{S_{\text{L1 TX}}}{S_{\text{calldata}}}
]</p>

<p><strong>Optimistic Rollup</strong>:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>L1 TX: ~110 bytes
Calldata: ~10 bytes (compressed)

R = 110 / 10 = 11× cheaper
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>ZK-Rollup</strong>:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>L1 TX: ~110 bytes
Proof overhead: Amortized over batch
Calldata per TX: ~5 bytes

R = 110 / 5 = 22× cheaper (even better!)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Actual Savings</strong> (real-world data):</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Ethereum L1: $5-50 per transaction
Optimism: $0.50-5 per transaction (10× cheaper)
Arbitrum: $0.30-3 per transaction (15× cheaper)
