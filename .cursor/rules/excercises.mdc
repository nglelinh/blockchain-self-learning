Blockchain Technology Exercises Rule (for Cursor)

Purpose:
Generate practical, project-based exercises that teach blockchain concepts through real-world tools and coding stacks used in the industry — rather than simplified notebook simulations.

Each exercise should:

Reinforce the lecture topic (cryptography, consensus, smart contracts, etc.)

Use modern blockchain development tools

End with a working demo, deployed locally or on a testnet

Encourage critical exploration, not rote coding

🧠 1. Stack and Environment

All exercises must use mainstream developer tools:

Category	Recommended Stack
Smart Contracts	Solidity, Hardhat, Truffle
Blockchain Node / Network	Ganache (local), Anvil, or Sepolia Testnet
Frontend Interaction	React + Web3.js or Ethers.js
Wallet Integration	MetaMask
Deployment / Verification	Hardhat plugins, Etherscan API
Optional Advanced	Foundry, Brownie (Python), Chainlink (for oracles)

Each exercise should mention setup commands, e.g.:

npx hardhat init
npm install --save-dev @nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox
npx hardhat node

📘 2. Exercise Format

Each exercise should follow this Markdown structure:

# Exercise: [Topic Title]

## 🎯 Objective
State what the learner will build and what concepts they’ll understand.

Example:
> Implement a simple Proof-of-Work blockchain in Solidity and deploy it on a local Hardhat node.

---

## 🧩 Prerequisites
List required tools or prior knowledge:
- Node.js ≥ 18
- Hardhat
- MetaMask wallet
- Basic Solidity syntax

---

## 🧠 Concepts Reinforced
- Blockchain immutability
- Smart contract logic
- Event logs and state changes
- Wallet and transaction flow

---

## ⚙️ Task Breakdown
Provide 3–6 steps, each mapping to key concepts.

Example:
1. **Initialize a new Hardhat project**
   ```bash
   npx hardhat init


Create a Solidity contract that stores messages on-chain.

Write deployment script using Hardhat.

Deploy to Ganache / Anvil local node.

Interact via MetaMask or a simple React frontend.

🧪 Verification & Exploration

Ask open-ended or exploratory questions:

What happens if two users submit at the same time?

How can you verify the contract address on Etherscan?

How does gas usage change with contract complexity?

🚀 Challenge Extension

Optional deeper work:

Add event emission and listen to it with Ethers.js.

Add access control using Ownable from OpenZeppelin.

Deploy to Sepolia or Polygon testnet.

### 🧱 3. Example Topics & Exercise Ideas

| Lecture Topic | Exercise Title | Description |
|----------------|----------------|--------------|
| Blockchain Basics | Build and Query a Simple Blockchain Explorer | Use Ethers.js to read blocks, transactions, and balances from a local node |
| Transactions | Simulate Wallet Transfers on Local Testnet | Send ETH between accounts using MetaMask + Hardhat |
| Smart Contracts | Create and Deploy a “Hello Blockchain” Contract | Solidity + Hardhat basic deployment |
| Storage and Gas | Analyze Gas Cost for State Updates | Compare cost of `storage` vs `memory` variables |
| Events and Logs | Listen to Smart Contract Events | Emit and subscribe to events using Web3.js |
| Access Control | Implement Ownable Pattern | Use OpenZeppelin’s `Ownable` contract |
| Tokens | Create and Deploy an ERC-20 Token | Mint, transfer, and view balance |
| NFTs | Mint Your First NFT | Implement ERC-721 contract and view it in MetaMask |
| Oracles | Use Chainlink Price Feed | Fetch off-chain data and use it in smart contract logic |
| Consensus | Analyze Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Stake | Compare mining simulation using block explorer |
| Layer 2 | Interact with Polygon Testnet | Deploy same contract and measure performance difference |
| DAO / Governance | Implement a Voting Smart Contract | Build a DAO-style on-chain voting app |

### 🧭 4. Design Philosophy

- Each exercise is **a mini project** — not a quiz.  
- Must produce something **runnable and observable** (deploy, call, verify).  
- Learner should understand:
  - what they did ✅  
  - why it works 🔍  
  - what could break ⚠️  
- Prefer **testnet deployments** over pure local simulation when possible.
- Encourage **reading transaction traces and gas reports**.

---

### 🧩 5. Optional Add-ons

For advanced learners:
- Integrate **Hardhat tests** with Chai.
- Write **scripts** for deployment automation.
- Visualize data using a simple **React dashboard**.
- Integrate **IPFS / Filecoin** for storage.
- Use **The Graph** for off-chain queries.
